We're excited to announce Boards v0.7.0, our biggest release yet! This version brings 20+ new AI generators spanning image, video, and audio generation, major UI/UX improvements, and critical infrastructure upgrades.

## 🎨 New AI Generators: A Creative Powerhouse

## 🎭 Dark Mode & Theme Support

Your eyes will thank you. Boards now supports full dark mode with a polished theme switcher.

### What's New

- **Light/Dark/System themes** - Choose your preference or follow your system settings
- **Semantic color tokens** - Consistent theming throughout the app
- **Smooth transitions** - No jarring flashes when switching themes
- **Persistent preferences** - Your theme choice is saved across sessions

The theme implementation uses `next-themes` with proper SSR hydration, ensuring a seamless experience without layout shifts or theme flashing.

## 📤 Multi-File Uploads

Gone are the days of uploading files one at a time. The new multi-file upload feature transforms how you work with assets.

### Key Features

- **Concurrent uploads** - Upload multiple files simultaneously with individual progress tracking
- **Drag & drop support** - Drop multiple files at once
- **Per-file progress** - See the status of each upload independently
- **Cancel functionality** - Stop individual uploads that are taking too long
- **Upload summary** - Get a complete report when all uploads finish

The `useMultiUpload` hook is available in the frontend package, making it easy to add multi-file upload to your own Boards applications.

## ✏️ Inline Board Title Editing

Quick edits are now truly quick. Click the edit icon next to any board title to rename it in place.

### Features

- **Inline editing** - No need to navigate to settings
- **Auto-focus** - Start typing immediately
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Validation** - Prevents empty titles and provides clear error messages
- **Optimistic updates** - UI responds immediately while saving in the background

## 🔍 Better Generator Selector

Finding the right generator is now effortless with our redesigned selector.

### Improvements

- **Search functionality** - Filter generators by name or description
- **Type filtering** - Quick filter pills for image, video, audio, and text
- **Recently used** - Your last 3 generators appear at the top for quick access
- **Keyboard navigation** - Auto-focus on the search field when opened
- **Persistent MRU list** - Recently used generators persist across sessions

The selector uses React's `useDeferredValue` for smooth performance even with many generators.

## 🗑️ Safe Generation Deletion

Delete generations you no longer need with confidence.

### Features

- **Confirmation dialog** - Prevents accidental deletions
- **Authorization checks** - Only board owners and generation creators can delete
- **Comprehensive deletion** - Removes both the generation record and storage artifacts
- **Clear feedback** - Toast notifications confirm successful deletion
- **Proper error handling** - Clear messages if deletion fails

The backend properly validates permissions and includes comprehensive test coverage for all authorization scenarios.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Improvements

Behind the scenes, we've made important upgrades to ensure Boards scales reliably.

### Thread-Safe Database Connections

The async database connection system now uses thread-local storage, preventing connection sharing across event loops. This is especially important for:

- Test runners with multiple threads
- Background workers
- Applications with concurrent async operations

The implementation follows SQLAlchemy best practices with proper initialization locks and resource cleanup.

### PostgreSQL Driver Upgrade

Migrated to **psycopg v3**, PostgreSQL's modern Python driver:

- Better async support
- Improved performance
- More robust connection pooling
- Enhanced type support

### Developer Experience

- **New `make format` command** - Auto-format both Python and JavaScript code
- **Improved documentation** - New Makefile command reference and architecture guides
- **CLI launcher fixes** - More reliable project scaffolding and management

---

## 📚 Documentation Updates

We've expanded our documentation to help you get the most out of Boards:

- **Architecture and Customization** - In-depth guide to Boards' architecture
- **GraphQL API documentation** - Detailed mutation documentation including authorization rules
- **README improvements** - Added links to docs and Discord community

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed download functionality** - Assets now download reliably
- **Fixed delete issues** - Generation deletion now works correctly in all scenarios
- **Various UI fixes** - Improved error handling and edge case behavior
