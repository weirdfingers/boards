# Node Package Management (pnpm)

Always use pnpm for Node dependency management in this repository.

- Do not use npm or yarn
- Monorepo commands run from the repo root unless a package-specific script is needed
- Workspace is defined via [pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml)

Common commands:

```bash
# Install deps
pnpm install

# Add dependencies
pnpm add <pkg>
pnpm add -D <pkg>

# Run scripts (workspace-aware)
pnpm run <script>
pnpm turbo <task>
```

Make targets integrate pnpm where appropriate; prefer Makefile for unified flows when available.
