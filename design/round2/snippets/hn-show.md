Title: Show HN: Boards – unify creating, storing, and sharing AI generations

We open‑sourced Boards to make it easy to build repeatable demos/products across many providers/models without juggling APIs or rebuilding infra.

What it is
- Python backend, React authoring toolkit, plugin system for providers/generators

What’s new
- <FEATURE>: <one‑liner>

Why it matters
- <PAIN> → <OUTCOME>

Try it
- Docs: <DOCS_URL>
- Repo: <REPO_URL>
- Demo video: <DEMO_URL>

We’d love feedback on DX, authoring primitives, and integration wishlist.
