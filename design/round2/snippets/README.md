# Snippets Usage

Quick, copy‑paste templates for each channel. Replace placeholders and post.

Placeholders to replace:

- <FEATURE>: short feature name
- <OUTCOME>: user benefit/result
- <PAIN>: concrete friction the feature removes
- <DOCS_URL>, <REPO_URL>, <DISCORD_URL>, <DEMO_URL>, <SHORT_URL>
- <STEPS>: 1–3 simple steps
- <PROVIDER>/<GENERATOR>: integration name

Recommended flow:

1. Pick one tiny story (feature/fix/example)
2. Record a 2–4 min demo + 30–45s short
3. Paste a template below, fill placeholders, post to channels
4. Add links to `../content-log.csv` and `../content-log.md`

Notes:

- Keep one CTA per post (star repo, try quickstart, join Discord)
- Respect subreddit/community rules; lead with value
- On Shorts/Reels/TikTok: hook in 2s, captions on, vertical 9:16
