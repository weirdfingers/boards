title: Organic Content Marketing Strategy (Developer-friendly)

## Purpose

Create a sustainable, low‑effort, high‑signal organic marketing system that a solo developer can run in 60–90 minutes per week. Focus on clarity, real demos, and consistent updates as the product evolves.

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

- Core pillar: ship small demos weekly, tell a simple story, invite collaboration
- Time budget: 60–90 minutes/week, optional 2–3 hours/month for deeper content
- Channels: X, Reddit, YouTube (Shorts + long), TikTok, Instagram (Reels), Facebook, Discord, GitHub (releases), plus optional: LinkedIn, Dev.to/Hashnode, Hacker News (Show HN), Product Hunt (launch waves)
- System: One demo → cross-format → cross-post → short CTA → pin in Discord → add to docs/examples → log in a public changelog
- North-star outcome: more usage, stars, Discord members, and contributors

## Audience Segments (from project design)

- Semi‑technical creators: want quick local workflows, easy UI, zero-config
- Technical developers: want SDK/hooks, flexible backend, custom frontends
- Vibe coders/entrepreneurs: want to ship fast, SaaS-friendly deployment
- No‑local vibe coders: want fully cloud-based flows
- Advanced integrators: want to add providers, generators, storage/auth plugins
- Model/LoRA authors: want a great demoing and distribution surface

## Positioning Narrative

- Why we built this: to unify creating, storing, reusing, and sharing AI multimedia artifacts from many models/providers—without learning a dozen APIs or rebuilding infra for every demo.
- What it is: a Python backend + React/Next authoring toolkit, with storage, auth, and an extensible provider/generator system.
- What it does: lets you generate images/audio/video/LoRAs, compose outputs into new workflows, and collaborate via boards.
- Who it’s for: builders at any skill level who want to move from “cool model” to “repeatable product demos” quickly.
- How to start: run the CLI, configure providers, open the example Next.js app, or import the React package to your app.
- How to contribute: add providers/generators, authoring components, docs/examples; pick “good first issues,” join Discord.

## Content Pillars

1) Why: motivation, pain points, design decisions
2) What: features, new provider/generator integrations, authoring primitives
3) How: short practical demos, copy‑pastable code, reproducible examples
4) Community: contributor spotlights, roadmap previews, Discord discussions
5) Proof: benchmarks where appropriate, real use cases, before/after workflows

## Core Assets (create once, reuse)

- Project one‑pager: goal, features, quickstart, links (repo, docs, Discord)
- 60–90s “What is Boards?” video (land on YouTube; trim for Shorts/Reels/TikTok)
- Starter demo set: 3 screen recordings showing end‑to‑end flows for key use cases
- Public changelog (GitHub releases + docs page)
- Contribution guide highlights (where to help, time-to-first‑PR, support channels)

## Weekly Cadence (60–90 minutes)

1) Pick one tiny story (5 min): new provider, generator, UI hook, or example
2) Record a 2–4 min screen capture (15 min): narrate: problem → what we built → result → how to try → CTA
3) Trim to vertical 30–45s (10 min): add captions & title slide; export 9:16
4) Write a short post (10 min): 3–5 sentences + 1–2 bullet key steps + CTA
5) Cross‑post (15–20 min): X, Reddit (one community), Discord, YT Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Facebook; optionally LinkedIn
6) Log it (5 min): add link to changelog/Release notes + examples index in docs

Optional monthly block (2–3 hours): deep-dive post on Dev.to/Hashnode + longer YouTube tutorial; batch‑record 2–3 shorts for the month.

## Channel Playbooks and Templates

General style: friendly, dev‑first, concrete. Avoid buzzwords. Show code or UI quickly. Always include a single CTA.

### X (Twitter)

Thread template (5 tweets):

```
1/ We just shipped <feature>. Why it matters: <pain → outcome>.
2/ What it does: <one-liner> + <gif/screenshot>.
3/ How to use: <1–2 steps or code>.
4/ Demo: <30–45s short link>.
5/ Try it + contribute: Repo <link>, Docs <link>, Discord <link>.
```

Single‑post template:

```
Shipped: <feature> for Boards – <benefit>. Demo ⤵️
<short video>
Docs: <link> • Repo: <link> • Discord: <link>
```

### Reddit (choose 1–2 fitting communities)

Post template:

```
Title: Open-source toolkit to create/store/share AI generations – now with <feature>

Problem → Solution
- Problem: <concrete friction>
- Solution: Boards integrates <provider/generator> with <N> lines of config.

Showcase
- 2–4 min demo: <link>
- Example repo/page: <link>

Details for devs
- Stack: Python backend, React authoring, extensible providers/generators
- How to try: <steps> or <docs link>

Feedback welcome. Happy to answer technical questions and roadmap ideas.
```

Communities to consider (be respectful of rules): r/MachineLearning, r/Artificial, r/StableDiffusion, r/LocalLLaMA, r/opensource, r/reactjs (when frontend‑relevant).

### Discord (your server)

Announcement template:

```
@everyone Shipped <feature> ✅

What: <one-liner>
Why: <pain → outcome>
Demo: <link>
Docs: <link>

Looking for: testers, feedback, and contributors for <areas>.
```

### YouTube

- Long (5–10 min): title “How to <achieve outcome> with Boards (<feature>)”
- Shorts (30–45s): hook in first 2 seconds; on‑screen steps; CTA at end

Description template:

```
In this demo we add <feature> to Boards so you can <outcome>.
Links: Docs <link> • Repo <link> • Discord <link>
Chapters: 00:00 intro · 00:20 setup · 02:00 demo · 03:30 how to try
```

### TikTok / Instagram Reels

- Hook formula: “I stopped doing X when building AI demos. Here’s why.” or “Turn <N> lines into <outcome> in 30s.”
- Visuals: cursor, terminal, quick results, captions on
- CTA: “Link in bio” or first comment pinned (point to docs/Discord)

Caption template:

```
Shipped <feature> for Boards → <outcome>. Free & open-source.
Docs <shortlink> • Repo <shortlink>
```

### Facebook

- Cross‑post the X single‑post copy with the 30–45s short. Keep concise.

### Optional Channels (use when relevant)

- LinkedIn: same X thread content condensed to 1 post; tag relevant providers
- Dev.to/Hashnode: monthly technical deep‑dive (1,000–1,500 words) + code
- Hacker News (Show HN): use for major milestone; focus on technical detail and lessons learned
- Product Hunt: plan a launch wave after multiple features land; include demo video, maker’s comment, FAQ

## Demo Production Checklist (10–30 minutes)

- Script the flow: problem → setup → run → result → next steps
- Record at 1440p+ for clean Shorts crops; capture cursor + keystrokes
- Keep cuts tight; add captions; loudness‑normalize audio
- Export: horizontal (YouTube), vertical (Shorts/Reels/TikTok)
- Thumbnail: big readable title, product mark, contrasting background

Tools (choose simple): OBS or ScreenStudio; CapCut or Descript for captions.

## Automation & Reuse (minimize effort)

- GitHub: use labels to auto‑generate release notes; include demo links
- Docs: maintain an “Examples” index page; embed shorts where relevant
- Snippets: keep social templates in `/design/round2/snippets/` for copy‑paste
- Cross‑posting: schedule uploads back‑to‑back; reuse the same description/CTA
- Tracking: maintain a simple CSV/markdown log with date, feature, links, metrics

Example content log row:

```
2025‑09‑05 | Provider: <name> | YT <link> | TikTok <link> | X <link> | Reddit <link> | Docs <link> | Notes <quick result>
```

## Simple KPIs (weekly)

- Input (you control): posts published, demos shipped
- Reach: video views (Shorts + TikTok), X impressions
- Engagement: comments + saves + Discord joins
- Project health: GitHub stars, new issues/PRs, unique contributors

Targets (initial): 1 demo/week, 5–10 posts/week (same demo cross‑posted), +10–25 stars/week, +10–25 Discord members/week.

## FAQ content (quick answers to reuse)

- What’s Boards? Toolkit to create/store/reuse/share AI artifacts across providers
- Why not just call providers directly? Unified API, storage, reusable authoring
- Local vs cloud? Works locally; supports cloud‑only workflows
- Can I add my model or LoRA? Yes—provider/generator plug‑in system + docs/examples
- Can I use only the frontend or backend? Yes—modular; use what you need

## Message Map (one-liners to reuse)

- “Go from cool model to repeatable product demo in minutes.”
- “One interface for many providers. Generate, store, compose, share.”
- “Make demos you can ship, not just screenshots.”

## CTAs (pick one per post)

- Star the repo
- Try the quickstart
- Watch the demo
- Join Discord and say hi
- Grab a good‑first issue

## Operational Notes

- Respect community rules (especially Reddit & HN); lead with value and detail
- Credit providers/models; include links and versions when relevant
- Keep a running backlog of “mini stories” to record next (bugs fixed, UX polish, tiny wins)
