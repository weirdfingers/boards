# Documentation Strategy

## Principles
- **Hooks-first** examples; minimal UI to spotlight data flows.
- LLM-friendly: concise API references, rich typing, copyable code blocks, deterministic headings.

## Site
- Docusaurus or MkDocs; auto-generated API docs (pdoc for Python, TS docgen for hooks).

## Example Tracks
- Your first image with `useGeneration`
- Building a custom auth provider with the adapter interface
- Creating a LoRA from a small dataset
- Board collaboration with RBAC
- Adding a new model/provider plugin

## Snippet Style
- Small, end-to-end runnable snippets with seed data and `.env.example`.
