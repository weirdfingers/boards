# Managing Module-Level State in Multiprocessing

**Author:** Design Notes
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** Best Practices

## The Problem

When using multiprocessing in Python (as Dramatiq does for workers), each process gets its own **independent copy** of module-level variables. They start with empty/initial state and don't share memory with the parent process or other worker processes.

This is fundamentally different from multithreading, where threads share the same memory space.

### Common Symptom

```python
# In parent process or main thread
registry = GeneratorRegistry()
load_generators_from_config()  # Registers 10 generators
print(len(registry))  # ‚Üí 10

# In worker process (spawned by Dramatiq)
print(len(registry))  # ‚Üí 0 (empty!)
```

**Why?** The worker process is a fresh Python interpreter that imports the modules from scratch. Module-level initialization code may or may not run depending on how it's structured.

## Multiprocessing vs Multithreading

| Aspect | Multithreading | Multiprocessing |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Memory** | Shared (same process) | Isolated (separate processes) |
| **State sharing** | Automatic | Must be explicit |
| **Race conditions** | ‚ùå Major risk - requires locks everywhere | ‚úÖ Impossible by default (isolated state) |
| **Debugging** | üî• Heisenbugs, non-deterministic | ‚úÖ Deterministic, isolated failures |
| **Python GIL** | ‚ùå Limits parallelism | ‚úÖ True parallelism |
| **Performance** | Fast (no IPC overhead) | Slower (serialization) |
| **Common bugs** | Data races, deadlocks, corrupted state | Forgot to initialize, state not shared |

**Bottom line:** Multiprocessing's "confusion tax" (state isolation) is far better than multithreading's "race condition tax" (data corruption and non-deterministic bugs).

## Pattern 1: Module-Level Lazy Initialization ‚≠ê

**Best for:** Simple registries, caches, connection pools that need one-time setup.

### Implementation

```python
# In actors.py (worker module)
from ..generators.loader import load_generators_from_config
from ..generators.registry import registry as generator_registry

# This runs once when each worker process imports the module
load_generators_from_config()
logger.info(
    "Generators loaded",
    count=len(generator_registry),
    generators=generator_registry.list_names(),
)

@actor
async def process_generation(generation_id: str) -> None:
    # Registry is already populated
    generator = generator_registry.get(name)
    await generator.generate(...)
```

### How It Works

- Module-level code runs **once per process** at import time
- Worker processes import the module when they start
- Each process gets its own initialized registry
- No per-job overhead

### Pros

‚úÖ Simple and explicit
‚úÖ No overhead per job
‚úÖ Works with fork and spawn process models
‚úÖ Easy to understand

### Cons

‚ùå Easy to forget in new modules
‚ùå No enforcement mechanism
‚ùå Not obvious to new developers
‚ùå Can't control initialization order across modules

### Example in Boards

We initially used this pattern in `boards/workers/actors.py` before migrating to middleware (Pattern 2).

---

## Pattern 2: Framework Middleware/Lifecycle Hooks ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Best for:** When your framework provides initialization hooks (Dramatiq, Celery, etc.).

### Implementation

```python
# In workers/middleware.py
from dramatiq.middleware import Middleware
from ..generators.loader import load_generators_from_config
from ..generators.registry import registry as generator_registry

class GeneratorLoaderMiddleware(Middleware):
    """Load generators when worker process starts."""

    def before_worker_boot(self, broker, worker):
        """Called once per worker process at startup."""
        logger.info("Loading generators in worker process")
        load_generators_from_config()
        logger.info(
            "Generators loaded",
            count=len(generator_registry),
            generators=generator_registry.list_names(),
        )

# In actors.py
broker = RedisBroker(url=settings.redis_url)
broker.add_middleware(AsyncIO())
broker.add_middleware(GeneratorLoaderMiddleware())  # ‚Üê Explicit initialization
```

### How It Works

- Framework calls middleware hooks at specific lifecycle points
- `before_worker_boot` runs once per worker process, before processing any jobs
- Middleware is registered explicitly in broker setup
- Centralized initialization logic

### Pros

‚úÖ **Explicit lifecycle management** - clear when/where initialization happens
‚úÖ **Self-documenting** - middleware list shows initialization steps
‚úÖ **Framework-integrated** - uses proper lifecycle hooks
‚úÖ **Discoverable** - easy for new developers to find
‚úÖ **Centralized** - one place to add worker initialization
‚úÖ **Testable** - can test middleware in isolation

### Cons

‚ùå Slightly more boilerplate
‚ùå Requires understanding framework's middleware API
‚ùå Framework-specific (not portable)

### Example in Boards

This is our **current pattern** for generator loading in `boards/workers/middleware.py`. This pattern is superior to Pattern 1 for production systems.

---

## Pattern 3: Lazy Initialization with Getters

**Best for:** When you want initialization to happen on first use, not at import time.

### Implementation

```python
# In registry.py
class GeneratorRegistry:
    _instance: GeneratorRegistry | None = None
    _initialized: bool = False

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def _ensure_loaded(self):
        """Load generators on first access."""
        if not self._initialized:
            from .loader import load_generators_from_config
            load_generators_from_config()
            self._initialized = True

    def get(self, name: str):
        self._ensure_loaded()
        return self._generators.get(name)

    def list_all(self):
        self._ensure_loaded()
        return list(self._generators.values())

# Usage in actors
@actor
async def process_generation(generation_id: str) -> None:
    # First call triggers initialization
    generator = generator_registry.get(name)
```

### How It Works

- Registry checks if loaded on every access
- First access triggers initialization
- Subsequent accesses use cached state
- Initialization is deferred until needed

### Pros

‚úÖ No explicit initialization needed
‚úÖ Happens automatically in each process
‚úÖ Works across all process spawn methods
‚úÖ Can't forget to initialize

### Cons

‚ùå Small overhead on every access (check if initialized)
‚ùå Makes initialization timing unpredictable
‚ùå Harder to debug (hidden initialization)
‚ùå Can't control when initialization happens
‚ùå Error handling is awkward (errors happen on first use)

### When to Use

- Configuration objects that are read-only after loading
- Caches that can be built on-demand
- Cases where you can't control import order

---

## Pattern 4: Dependency Injection (Most Testable)

**Best for:** Maximizing testability and making dependencies explicit.

### Implementation

```python
# In executors.py (business logic, not actors)
async def execute_generation(
    generation_id: str,
    registry: GeneratorRegistry,  # ‚Üê Explicit dependency
    db_session: AsyncSession,
    progress_publisher: ProgressPublisher,
) -> None:
    """Pure function with explicit dependencies."""
    generator = registry.get(generator_name)
    # ... do work ...

# In workers/actors.py
_registry: GeneratorRegistry | None = None

def _get_registry() -> GeneratorRegistry:
    """Get or initialize registry (module-level singleton)."""
    global _registry
    if _registry is None:
        load_generators_from_config()
        _registry = registry
    return _registry

@actor
async def process_generation(generation_id: str) -> None:
    """Actor is thin wrapper that handles initialization."""
    reg = _get_registry()
    async with get_async_session() as db:
        publisher = ProgressPublisher()
        await execute_generation(generation_id, reg, db, publisher)
```

### How It Works

- Business logic receives dependencies as parameters (pure functions)
- Actors/entry points handle initialization and dependency wiring
- Core logic has no global state or imports
- Tests can inject mocks easily

### Pros

‚úÖ **Extremely testable** - can inject mocks without patching
‚úÖ **Clear dependencies** - function signature shows what's needed
‚úÖ **Reusable logic** - same function works in different contexts
‚úÖ **No hidden coupling** - all dependencies explicit
‚úÖ **Easy to refactor** - change initialization without touching logic

### Cons

‚ùå More boilerplate (passing parameters)
‚ùå More indirection (separation of concerns)
‚ùå Actors become thin wrappers
‚ùå Can feel over-engineered for simple cases

### When to Use

- Complex business logic that needs thorough testing
- Code that will be reused in multiple contexts (CLI, API, workers)
- Teams with strong testing culture
- Long-term maintainability is critical

## Recommendations for Boards

### Current Implementation (October 2024)

We use **Pattern 2: Middleware Hooks** for generator loading:

```python
# workers/middleware.py
class GeneratorLoaderMiddleware(Middleware):
    def before_worker_boot(self, broker, worker):
        load_generators_from_config()

# workers/actors.py
broker.add_middleware(GeneratorLoaderMiddleware())
```

This is the **recommended pattern** for our use case because:

1. ‚úÖ **Explicit** - middleware list documents all initialization
2. ‚úÖ **Framework-native** - uses Dramatiq's proper lifecycle hooks
3. ‚úÖ **Discoverable** - new developers can see the middleware setup
4. ‚úÖ **Centralized** - one place for all worker initialization
5. ‚úÖ **No overhead** - initialization happens once per worker at startup

### Future Considerations

If we need more testability or want to reuse generation logic outside workers (e.g., in a CLI tool), consider migrating to **Pattern 4: Dependency Injection**:

- Extract `execute_generation()` as a pure function
- Keep actors as thin wrappers that wire dependencies
- Makes testing much easier without Dramatiq mocks

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't initialize in CLI parent process** - worker processes won't see it
‚ùå **Don't use threading locks** - not needed with multiprocessing
‚ùå **Don't use shared memory** - complex, error-prone, usually unnecessary
‚ùå **Don't rely on module import side effects** - use explicit initialization

## Process Spawn Methods

Python's multiprocessing has different spawn methods:

### Fork (Linux default, deprecated on macOS)

- **How it works:** Copies parent process memory (copy-on-write)
- **Module state:** Inherited from parent
- **Pros:** Fast, memory-efficient
- **Cons:** Can corrupt file descriptors, SSL connections, database pools
- **macOS:** Deprecated in Python 3.8+, will be removed

### Spawn (macOS/Windows default)

- **How it works:** Fresh Python interpreter
- **Module state:** Starts empty, must be initialized
- **Pros:** Clean state, no corruption issues
- **Cons:** Slower startup, higher memory usage
- **Pattern requirement:** MUST use explicit initialization

### Recommendation

**Always use spawn mode** or write code that works with spawn (like Patterns 2-4). This ensures:

1. ‚úÖ Works on all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
2. ‚úÖ No subtle bugs from inherited state
3. ‚úÖ Future-proof (fork is being deprecated)
4. ‚úÖ Clean worker processes

To enforce spawn mode:

```python
# In cli.py
import multiprocessing as mp
mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)
```

However, our current approach (Pattern 2 with middleware) works with **any** spawn method, which is ideal.

## Real-World Examples in Boards

### Example 1: Redis Connection Pool

Our `RedisPoolManager` is a singleton that initializes per-process:

```python
# redis_pool.py
class RedisPoolManager:
    _instance: RedisPoolManager | None = None
    _pool: ConnectionPool | None = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

This works because:
- Each process gets its own connection pool (good - connections aren't shared)
- Initialization happens on first use in each process
- No shared state between processes

### Example 2: Generator Registry (Current)

We load generators via middleware (Pattern 2):

```python
# workers/middleware.py
class GeneratorLoaderMiddleware(Middleware):
    def before_worker_boot(self, broker, worker):
        load_generators_from_config()

# workers/actors.py
broker.add_middleware(GeneratorLoaderMiddleware())
```

This ensures:
- Generators loaded once per worker at startup
- Explicit initialization visible in middleware list
- Framework-managed lifecycle

### Example 3: SQLAlchemy Sessions

We use context managers for sessions (good pattern):

```python
@actor
async def process_generation(generation_id: str):
    async with get_async_session() as session:
        # Session is per-job, not shared
        gen = await jobs_repo.get_generation(session, generation_id)
```

This is correct because:
- Sessions are per-job, not module-level
- No shared state
- Proper cleanup via context manager

## Debugging Tips

### How to Detect the Problem

**Symptom:** Code works in main process but fails in workers

```python
# In main process
print(len(registry))  # ‚Üí 10 generators

# In worker process
print(len(registry))  # ‚Üí 0 generators (bug!)
```

**How to debug:**

1. Add logging at module import time:
   ```python
   logger.info("Module imported", pid=os.getpid())
   ```

2. Log state at key points:
   ```python
   logger.info("Registry state", count=len(registry), pid=os.getpid())
   ```

3. Check if PIDs are different (confirms multiprocessing)

### Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Initializing only in parent:**
```python
# cli.py
load_generators_from_config()  # ‚Üê Only loads in parent!
dramatiq_main()  # Workers won't have generators
```

‚ùå **Assuming fork copies state:**
```python
# Assumes fork will copy parent's registry
# Breaks on macOS/Windows with spawn!
```

‚úÖ **Correct: Initialize in each worker:**
```python
# Via middleware (Pattern 2)
class GeneratorLoaderMiddleware(Middleware):
    def before_worker_boot(self, broker, worker):
        load_generators_from_config()  # ‚Üê Runs in each worker
```

## Conclusion

For Boards workers:

1. **Use Pattern 2 (Middleware)** for framework-managed initialization ‚úÖ
2. **Avoid module-level implicit initialization** - hard to discover
3. **Consider Pattern 4 (DI)** if testability becomes a priority
4. **Always test with spawn mode** - ensures cross-platform compatibility
5. **Remember:** Multiprocessing isolation is a feature, not a bug!

The key insight: **Multiprocessing's "confusion tax" (state not shared) is infinitely better than multithreading's "race condition tax" (data corruption).**
